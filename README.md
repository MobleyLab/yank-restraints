# yank-restraints
## Benchmarking project testing different restraints schemes for free energy calculations with Yank.

This repository houses all the files for the restraints project. Here you will find all the files needed to run YANK simulations on host-guest (cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol) and T4 lysozyme (T4 lysozyme L99A-toluene) complexes.
