# Restraints evaluation using asymmetric cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex

Here you will find the yaml files used to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric cyclodextrin-cyplopentanol complex using several types of restraints : harmonic, orientational and flat bottom restraints (with a well radius of 5 Ã…).
