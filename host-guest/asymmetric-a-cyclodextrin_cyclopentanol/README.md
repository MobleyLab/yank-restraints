# Restraints evaluation using asymmetric cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex

Here you will find the yaml files used to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric cyclodextrin-cyplopentanol complex using several types of restraints : harmonic, orientational and flat bottom restraints (with a well radius of 5 Å). The mol2 files of asymmetric α-cyclodextrin and cyclopentanol are in the subdirectory [`input`](input).
