# Restraints evaluation using asymmetric cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex

Here you will find the yaml files used to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric cyclodextrin-cyplopentanol complex using several types of restraints.

## Manifest

- [`harmonic.yaml`](harmonic.yaml): yaml file to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric α-cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex using harmonic restraints.
- [`boresch.yaml`](boresch.yaml): yaml file to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric α-cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex using Boresch style restraints.
- [`flatbottom_5.yaml`]( flatbottom_5.yaml): yaml file to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric α-cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex using flat bottom restraints and a well radius of 5 Å.
- [`null.yaml`](null.yaml): yaml file to compute the binding affinity of asymmetric α-cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex without applying a restraint to the ligand.
- [`input`](input): subdirectory containing the mol2 files of asymmetric α-cyclodextrin and cyclopentanol.
