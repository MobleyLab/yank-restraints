Mike Gilson Lab provided the apo asymmetric Î±-cyclodextrin (MGLab-8) structure. An energy minimization was performed on MGLab-8 using the general Amber force field (GAFF2) and the OpenMM molecular dynamics package; then, the 3D structure of cyclopentanol ([Mobley, D.L., Heinzelmann, G., Henriksen, N.M. and Gilson, M.K., 2017. Predicting binding free energies: Frontiers and benchmarks (a perpetual review)](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets)) was docked in the MGLab-8 binding pocket using OpenEye toolkits (FRED).
