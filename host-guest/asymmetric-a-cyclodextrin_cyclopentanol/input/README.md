# File Descriptions

Mike Gilson Lab provided the apo asymmetric Î±-cyclodextrin (MGLab-8) structure. An energy minimization was performed using AMBER 16 on MGLab-8; then, the 3D structure of cyclopentanol (Mobley et al., 2017) was docked in the MGLab-8 binding pocket using OpenEye toolkits (FRED).
