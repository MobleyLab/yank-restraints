# Restraints evaluation using symmetric cyclodextrin-cyclopentanol complex

Here you will find the yaml files used to compute the binding affinity of symmetric cyclodextrin-cyplopentanol complex using several types of restraints: harmonic, orientational and flat bottom restraints. For flat bottom restraints, there are yaml files using a well radius of 5, 15, 20 and 35 Å.
